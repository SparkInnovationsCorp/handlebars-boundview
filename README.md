# HandlebarsBoundView Class

The `HandlebarsBoundView` class offers a robust solution for integrating Handlebars templates with JavaScript, facilitating the development of dynamic and responsive web applications. This document provides a comprehensive guide on how to leverage this class for effective front-end development.

## Features

- **Dynamic Template Binding:** Simplifies the integration of Handlebars templates into your application, enabling real-time UI updates.
- **Event Handling:** Streamlines the process of binding events to DOM elements, with support for custom callback functions.
- **Data Binding:** Implements two-way data binding, keeping your UI in sync with the underlying data model.
- **Custom Handlebars Helpers:** Facilitates the registration of custom Handlebars helpers for extended template functionality.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure Handlebars.js is included in your project. You can add it via CDN:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/handlebars/dist/handlebars.min.js"></script>
```

### Installation

Copy the `HandlebarsBoundView` class code into your project, or include it as a module, depending on your setup.

### Usage

Extend the `HandlebarsBoundView` to create your custom components:

```javascript
class MyCustomComponent extends HandlebarsBoundView {
    constructor(target) {
        super(target, "path/to/your/template.html");
        // Initialize component state here
    }
    // Component methods and logic go here
}
```

Define a Handlebars template for your component:

```html
<!-- path/to/your/template.html -->
<div>
    {{#each items}}
        <div>{{this}}</div>
    {{/each}}
</div>
```

Initialize your component within the application:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    const component = new MyCustomComponent("#component-target");
    component.render();
});
```

## Advanced Features

## Control Binding with the `bind` Keyword

Control binding is a powerful feature in `HandlebarsBoundView` that enables two-way data binding between your JavaScript object properties and HTML form elements. This mechanism keeps your UI in sync with your application's state without requiring additional code to update the UI manually when the data changes.

### How It Works

The `bind` keyword is used within your Handlebars templates to specify which property of your JavaScript object should be bound to a particular UI element. When the property's value changes, the UI automatically updates to reflect the new value. Similarly, when the UI element's value changes (e.g., through user input), the corresponding property on your JavaScript object is updated to reflect that change.

### Usage

To use control binding, add a `bind` attribute to an HTML element in your Handlebars template. The value of this attribute should be the path to the property you wish to bind. The `HandlebarsBoundView` class takes care of the rest, automatically setting up the two-way binding.

Please note, binding to 'this' will bind to the local data structure in handlebars.  Binding to 'base' binds to the base of the controller class.

```html
<!-- Template example with control binding -->
<input type="text" {{{bind "this.propertyName"}}} />


### Event Binding

Use the built-in methods to attach events to your template elements:

```html
<button {{{click "handleClick"}}}>Click me</button>
```

```javascript
handleClick() {
    console.log('Button was clicked!');
}
```
